# ConflictRevealer
Here we present the data and modules that enable testing the results of our research on a ranking method based on the assessment of city-to-city similarity, which we used to evaluate the potential for social conflict.

* Ranking method.ipynb - the module that implements the proposed method
* Potential for social conflict.csv - this file contains the output results generated by the Ranking method.ipynb
